# Setup

We provide a pre-compiled `walrus` client binary for macOS (Intel and Apple CPUs) and Ubuntu, which
supports different usage patterns (see [the next chapter](./interacting.md)). This chapter describes
the [prerequisites](#prerequisites), [installation](#installation), and
[configuration](#configuration) of the Walrus client.

Walrus is open-source under an Apache 2 license, and can also be built and installed from the Rust
source code via cargo.

```admonish info title="Walrus networks"
This page describes how to connect to Walrus **Mainnet**. See [Available networks](./networks.md)
for an overview over all Walrus networks.
```

## Prerequisites: Sui wallet, SUI and WAL {#prerequisites}

```admonish tip title="Quick wallet setup"
If you just want to set up a new Sui wallet for Walrus, you can generate one using the
`walrus generate-sui-wallet --sui-network mainnet` command after [installing Walrus](#installation).
You still need to obtain some SUI and WAL tokens, but you do not have to install the Sui CLI.
```

Interacting with Walrus requires a valid Sui wallet with some amount of SUI and WAL tokens. The
normal way to set this up is via the Sui CLI; see the [installation
instructions](https://docs.sui.io/guides/developer/getting-started/sui-install) in the Sui
documentation.

After installing the Sui CLI, you need to set up a wallet by running `sui client`, which
prompts you to set up a new configuration. Make sure to point it to Sui Mainnet, you can use the
full node at `https://fullnode.mainnet.sui.io:443` for this. See [the Sui
documentation](https://docs.sui.io/guides/developer/getting-started/connect) for further details.

After this, you should get something like this (everything besides the `mainnet` line is optional):

```terminal
$ sui client envs
╭──────────┬─────────────────────────────────────┬────────╮
│ alias    │ url                                 │ active │
├──────────┼─────────────────────────────────────┼────────┤
│ devnet   │ https://fullnode.devnet.sui.io:443  │        │
│ localnet │ http://127.0.0.1:9000               │        │
│ testnet  │ https://fullnode.testnet.sui.io:443 │        │
│ mainnet  │ https://fullnode.mainnet.sui.io:443 │ *      │
╰──────────┴─────────────────────────────────────┴────────╯
```

Make sure you have at least one gas coin with at least 1 SUI.

```terminal
$ sui client gas
╭─────────────────┬────────────────────┬──────────────────╮
│ gasCoinId       │ mistBalance (MIST) │ suiBalance (SUI) │
├─────────────────┼────────────────────┼──────────────────┤
│ 0x65dca966dc... │ 1000000000         │ 1.00             │
╰─────────────────┴────────────────────┴──────────────────╯
```

Finally, to publish blobs on Walrus you will need some Mainnet WAL to pay for storage and upload
costs. You can buy WAL through a variety of centralized or decentralized exchanges.

The system-wide wallet will be used by Walrus if no other path is specified. If you want to use a
different Sui wallet, you can specify this in the [Walrus configuration file](#configuration) or
when [running the CLI](./interacting.md).

## Installation

We currently provide the `walrus` client binary for macOS (Intel and Apple CPUs), Ubuntu, and
Windows. The Ubuntu version most likely works on other Linux distributions as well.

### Install via script {#nix-install}

To download and install `walrus` to your `"$HOME"/.local/bin` directory, run one of the following
commands in your terminal then follow on-screen instructions. If you are on Windows, see the
[Windows-specific instructions](#windows-install) or the [`suiup` installation](#suiup-install) (experimental)

```sh
# Run a first-time install using the latest Mainnet version.
curl -sSf https://install.wal.app | sh

# Install the latest Testnet version instead.
curl -sSf https://install.wal.app | sh -s -- -n testnet

# Update an existing installation (overwrites prior version of walrus).
curl -sSf https://install.wal.app | sh -s -- -f
```

Make sure that the `"$HOME"/.local/bin` directory is in your `$PATH`.

Once this is done, you should be able to run Walrus by using the `walrus` command in your terminal.

You can see usage instructions as follows (see [the next chapter](./interacting.md) for further
details):

```terminal
$ walrus --help
Walrus client

Usage: walrus [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>

Commands:
⋮
```

```admonish tip
Our latest Walrus binaries are also available on Walrus itself, namely on
<https://bin.wal.app>, for example, <https://bin.wal.app/walrus-mainnet-latest-ubuntu-x86_64>.
Note that due to DoS protection, it may not be possible to download the binaries with `curl` or
`wget`.
```

### Install on Windows {#windows-install}

To download `walrus` to your Microsoft Windows computer, run the following in a PowerShell.

```PowerShell
(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile(
  "https://storage.googleapis.com/mysten-walrus-binaries/walrus-testnet-latest-windows-x86_64.exe",
  "walrus.exe"
)
```

From there, you'll need to place `walrus.exe` somewhere in your `PATH`.

```admonish title="Windows"
Note that most of the remaining instructions assume a UNIX-based system for the directory structure,
commands, etc. If you use Windows, you may need to adapt most of those.
```

### Install via suiup (experimental) {#suiup-install}

`suiup` is a tool to install and manage different versions of CLI tools for working in the Sui
ecosystem, including the `walrus` CLI. After installing `suiup` as described in the [`suiup`
documentation](https://github.com/MystenLabs/suiup?tab=readme-ov-file#installation), you can install
specific versions of the `walrus` CLI:

```sh
suiup install walrus@testnet # install the latest testnet release
suiup install walrus@mainnet # install the latest mainnet release
suiup install walrus@testnet-v1.27.1 # install a specific release
```

### GitHub releases

You can find all our releases including release notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/MystenLabs/walrus/releases).
Simply download the archive for your system and extract the `walrus` binary.

### Install via Cargo

You can also install Walrus via Cargo. For example, to install the latest Mainnet version:

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/MystenLabs/walrus --branch mainnet walrus-service --locked
```

In place of `--branch mainnet`, you can also specify specific tags (e.g., `--tag mainnet-v1.18.2`)
or commits (e.g., `--rev b2009ac73388705f379ddad48515e1c1503fc8fc`).

### Build from source

Walrus is open-source software published under the Apache 2 license. The code is developed in a
`git` repository at <https://github.com/MystenLabs/walrus>.

The latest version of Mainnet and Testnet are available under the branches `mainnet` and `testnet`
respectively, and the latest version under the `main` branch. We welcome reports of issues and bug
fixes. Follow the instructions in the `README.md` file to build and use Walrus from source.

## Configuration

The Walrus client needs to know about the Sui objects that store the Walrus system and staking
information, see the [developer guide](../dev-guide/sui-struct.md#system-and-staking-information).
These need to be configured in a file `~/.config/walrus/client_config.yaml`.

You can access Testnet and Mainnet via the following configuration. Note that this example Walrus
CLI configuration refers to the standard location for Sui configuration
(`"~/.sui/sui_config/client.yaml"`).

```yaml
{{ #include ../setup/client_config.yaml }}
```

<!-- markdownlint-disable code-fence-style -->

````admonish tip
The easiest way to obtain the latest configuration is by downloading it directly from Walrus:

```sh
curl https://docs.wal.app/setup/client_config.yaml -o ~/.config/walrus/client_config.yaml
```
````

<!-- markdownlint-enable code-fence-style -->

### Custom path (optional) {#config-custom-path}

By default, the Walrus client will look for the `client_config.yaml` (or `client_config.yml`)
configuration file in the current directory, `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/walrus/`, `~/.config/walrus/`, or
`~/.walrus/`. However, you can place the file anywhere and name it anything you like; in this case
you need to use the `--config` option when running the `walrus` binary.

### Advanced configuration (optional)

The configuration file currently supports the following parameters for each of the contexts:

```yaml
# These are the only mandatory fields. These objects are specific for a particular Walrus
# deployment but then do not change over time.
system_object: 0x2134d52768ea07e8c43570ef975eb3e4c27a39fa6396bef985b5abc58d03ddd2
staking_object: 0x10b9d30c28448939ce6c4d6c6e0ffce4a7f8a4ada8248bdad09ef8b70e4a3904

# You can specify a list of Sui RPC URLs for reads. If none is provided, the RPC URL in the Sui
# wallet is used.
rpc_urls:
  - https://fullnode.mainnet.sui.io:443

# You can define a custom path to your Sui wallet configuration here. If this is unset or `null`
# (default), the wallet is configured from `./sui_config.yaml` (relative to your current working
# directory), or the system-wide wallet at `~/.sui/sui_config/client.yaml` in this order. Both
# `active_env` and `active_address` can be omitted, in which case the values from the Sui wallet
# are used.
wallet_config:
  # The path to the wallet configuration file.
  path: ~/.sui/sui_config/client.yaml
  # The optional `active_env` to use to override whatever `active_env` is listed in the
  # configuration file.
  active_env: mainnet
  # The optional `active_address` to use to override whatever `active_address` is listed in the
  # configuration file.
  active_address: 0x...

# [...]
```

There are some additional parameters that can be used to tune the networking behavior of the client,
see the [full example client configuration](../setup/client_config_example.yaml). If you experience
excessively slow uploads, it may be worth experimenting with these values. There is no risk in
playing around with these values; in the worst case, you may not be able to store/read blob due to
timeouts or other networking errors.
