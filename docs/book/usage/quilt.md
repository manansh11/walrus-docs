# Quilt: Walrus native batch store tool

*Quilt* is a batch storage feature, aiming to optimize the storage cost and efficiency of large
numbers of small blobs. Prior to *quilt*, storing small blobs (less than 10MB) in Walrus
involved higher per-byte costs due to internal system data overhead. *Quilt* addresses this by
encoding multiple (up to 666 for QuiltV1) blobs into a single unit called a quilt, significantly
reducing Walrus storage overhead and lowering costs to purchase Walrus/Sui storage, as well as Sui
computation gas fees.

Importantly, each blob within a quilt can be accessed and retrieved individually, without needing
to download the entire quilt. Moreover, the blob boundaries in a quilt align with Walrus
internal structures as well as Walrus storage nodes, this allows for retrieval latency that is
comparable to, or even lower than, that of a regular blob.

In addition, *quilt* introduces custom, immutable `Walrus-native` blob metadata, allowing user to
assign different types of `metadata` to each blob in a quilt, for example, unique identifiers, as
well as tags of key-value pairs. Note, this metadata is functionally similar to the existing
Blob Metadata store on-chain, however, there are some fundamental distinctions. First,
`Walrus-native` metadata is stored alongside the blob data, and hence it reduces costs and
simplifies management. Second, this metadata can be used for efficient lookup of blobs within a
quilt, for example, reading blobs with a particular tag. When storing a quilt, users can set
the `Walrus-native` metadata via the *quilt* APIs.

```admonish warning
An identifier must start with an alphanumeric character, contain no trailing whitespace,
and not exceed 64 KB in length.

The total size of all tags combined must not exceed 64 KB.
```

## Important considerations

It's important to note that blobs stored in a quilt are assigned a unique ID, called `QuiltPatchId`,
that differs from the `BlobId` used for regular Walrus blobs, and a `QuiltPatchId` is determined by
the composition of the entire quilt, ranther than the single blob, and hence it may change if the
blob is stored in a different quilt. Moreover, individual blobs cannot be deleted, extended or shared
separately; these operations can only be applied to the entire quilt.

## Target use cases

Using *quilt* requires minimal additional effort beyond standard procedures. The primary
considerations are that the unique ID assigned to each blob within a quilt cannot be
directly derived from its contents, unlike a regular Walrus blob_id, deletion, extension
and share operations are not allowed on individual blobs in the quilt, only the quilt
can be the target.

### Lower cost

This is the most clear and significant use case. *Quilt* is especially advantageous for
managing large volumes of small blobs, as long as they can be grouped together by the
user. The cost savings come from two sources:

- **Walrus storage and write fees**: By consolidating multiple small blobs into a single
    quilt, storage costs can be reduced dramatically—more than 400x for files around 10KB—making
    it an efficient solution for cost-sensitive applications.

- **Sui computation and object storage fees**: Storing many blobs as a single quilt
    significantly reduces Sui gas costs. In our test runs with 600 files stored in a quilt,
    we observed **238x** savings in Sui fees compared to storing them as individual blobs.
    Notably, Sui cost savings only depend on the number of files per quilt rather than the
    individual file sizes.

The following table demonstrates the potential cost savings in WAL when storing 600 small
blobs for 1 epoch as a quilt compared to storing them as separate blobs.

| Blob size | Regular blob storage cost | Quilt storage cost | Cost saving factor |
|----------:|--------------------------:|-------------------:|-------------------:|
|      10KB |                 2.088 WAL |          0.005 WAL |               409x |
|      50KB |                 2.088 WAL |          0.011 WAL |               190x |
|     100KB |                 2.088 WAL |          0.020 WAL |               104x |
|     200KB |                 2.088 WAL |          0.036 WAL |                58x |
|     500KB |                 2.136 WAL |          0.084 WAL |                25x |
|       1MB |                 2.208 WAL |          0.170 WAL |                13x |

### Organizing collections

*Quilt* provides a straightforward way to organize and manage collections of small blobs
within a single unit. This can simplify data handling and improve operational efficiency
when working with related small files, such as NFT image collections.

### Walrus native blob metadata

*Quilt* supports immutable, custom metadata stored directly in Walrus, including
identifiers and tags. These features facilitate better organization, enable flexible
lookup, and assist in managing blobs within each quilt, enhancing retrieval and
management processes.
