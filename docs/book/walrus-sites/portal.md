# The Walrus Sites portal

We use the term "portal" to indicate any technology that is used to access and browse Walrus Sites.
As mentioned in the [overview](./overview.md#the-site-rendering-path), we foresee three kinds of
portals:

1. server-side portals;
1. custom local apps; and
1. service-worker based portals running in the browser.

Currently, only a server-side portal is served at <https://wal.app>.

```admonish warning title="Important: Testnet Portal Access"
<https://wal.app> only serves sites deployed on mainnet, linked with SuiNS names.
You can run a portal to access mainnet sites as well.
Walrus Foundation does not maintain a Portal that serves testnet Walrus Sites.
To access Sites deployed on testnet you can either use a thirdparty testnet portal,
self-host one or run one locally.
```

We maintain a list of known portals. New portals can self-identify by opening a PR to add themselves
to the list.

## Known portals

Portals can self-identify by opening a PR that adds an entry to `docs/book/portals/list.json`.

{{#if portals}}
{{#each portals}}

- `{{@key}}{{#if this.operator}} ({{this.operator}}){{/if}}`
  {{/each}}
  {{else}}
- `https://wal.app (operated by Mysten Labs)`
  {{/if}}

```admonish note title="Hosting of the service worker"
The service-worker portal is no longer hosted, but you can still run it locally. Its code is
available in the `walrus-sites` repository. For more information, see
[running a local portal](#running-a-local-portal).
```

```admonish danger title="Walrus Sites stable branch"
The stable branch of Walrus Sites is `mainnet`.
```

## Running a local portal

Running a portal locally can be useful, for example if you want to browse Walrus Sites without
accessing external portals, or for development purposes.

Let's start by cloning the `walrus-sites` repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MystenLabs/walrus-sites.git
cd walrus-sites
```

Make sure you are on the stable branch:

```sh
git checkout mainnet
```

Next, we will see how to configure the portal so it can support the functionality that
we need.

### Configuration

Portal configuration is managed through two key elements:

- Environment variables: Required for basic functionality.
- Constants file: Optional for advanced customization.

#### Environment Variables

The environment variables are set in the `.env.local` file at the root of each portal directory.
To just run a simple instance of a portal, you can use the environment variables specified
in the `.env.<network>.example` file:

##### Mainnet Server Portal Environment Variables

```sh
cp ./portal/server/.env.mainnet.example ./portal/server/.env.local
```

##### Testnet Server Portal Environment Variables

```sh
cp ./portal/server/.env.testnet.example ./portal/server/.env.local
```

Likewise, if you want to run the service-worker portal, you can copy the `.env.<network>.example`
file to `.env.local` in the `portal/worker` directory.

##### Mainnet Service Worker Portal Environment Variables

```sh
cp ./portal/worker/.env.mainnet.example ./portal/worker/.env.local
```

##### Testnet Service Worker Portal Environment Variables

```sh
cp ./portal/worker/.env.testnet.example ./portal/worker/.env.local
```

For a more detailed configuration, you can modify the `.env.local` files to suit your needs.
As a reference, here are the definitions of the environment variables:

```admonish note
The server portal code contains additional functionality that can be enabled or disabled
using environment variables. For example, you can enable or disable the blocklist feature
by setting the `ENABLE_BLOCKLIST` variable to `true` or `false`. This can be helpful to
manage the behavior of the portal. For example, if you host a publicly-accessible portal, you might want to avoid
serving sites that are not published by you.
```

- `AGGREGATOR_URL`: The url to a Walrus aggregator that will fetch the site resources from Walrus.

- `AMPLITUDE_API_KEY`: Provide it if you want to enable [Amplitude](https://amplitude.com/) for your
  server analytics.

- `EDGE_CONFIG`: If you host your portal on Vercel, you can use the [Edge Config][edge-config] to
  blocklist certain SuiNS subdomains or b36 object ids.

- `EDGE_CONFIG_ALLOWLIST`: Similar to blocklist, but allows certain subdomains to use the premium
  rpc url list.

- `ENABLE_ALLOWLIST`: Enable the allowlist feature.

- `ENABLE_BLOCKLIST`: Enable the blocklist feature.

- `ENABLE_SENTRY`: Enable Sentry error tracking.

- `ENABLE_VERCEL_WEB_ANALYTICS`: Enable Vercel web analytics.

- `LANDING_PAGE_OID_B36`: The b36 object id of the landing page Walrus Site. i.e. the page you get
  when you visit `localhost:3000`.

- `PORTAL_DOMAIN_NAME_LENGTH`: If you connect your portal with a domain name, specify the length of
  the domain name. e.g. `example.com` has a length of 11.

- `PREMIUM_RPC_URL_LIST`: A list of rpc urls that are used when a site belongs to the allowlist.

- `RPC_URL_LIST`: A list of rpc urls that are used when a site does not belong to the allowlist.

- `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`: If you enable Sentry error tracking, provide your Sentry auth token.

- `SENTRY_DSN`: If you enable Sentry error tracking, provide your Sentry DSN.

- `SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE`: If you enable Sentry error tracking, provide the sample rate for
  traces.

- `SITE_PACKAGE`: The Walrus Site package id. Depending on the network you are using, you will
  have to specify the correct package id.

- `SUINS_CLIENT_NETWORK`: The network of the SuiNS client.

- `B36_DOMAIN_RESOLUTION_SUPPORT`: Define if b36 domain resolution is supported. Otherwise the
  site will not be served.

#### Constants

You can find the `constants.ts` file in the `portal/common/lib` directory. It holds key
configuration parameters for the portal. Typically, you won't need to modify these, but if you do,
here are the explanations for each parameter:

- `MAX_REDIRECT_DEPTH`: The number of [redirects](./redirects.md) the portal will follow
  before stopping.
- `SITE_NAMES`: Hard coded `name: objectID` mappings, to override the SuiNS names. For development
  only. Use this at your own risk, may render some sites with legitimate SuiNS names unusable.

- `FALLBACK_PORTAL`: This is related only to the service worker portal. The fallback portal should
  be a server-side portal that is used in cases where some browsers do not support service workers.

### Deploying the Portal

To run the portal locally you can either use a Docker container or a local development environment.

You can run the portal via Docker for a quick setup, or use a local development environment if you
want to modify the code or contribute to the project.

#### Docker

First, make sure you have Docker installed on your system.

```sh
docker --version
```

If it is not installed, follow the instructions on the [Docker website][get-docker].

Then, build the Docker image with:

```sh
docker build -f portal/docker/server/Dockerfile -t server-portal . --build-arg ENABLE_SENTRY=false --no-cache
```

Finally, run the Docker container:

```sh
docker run --env-file ./portal/server/.env.local -p 3000:3000 server-portal
```

Browse the sites at `localhost:3000`.

#### Local Development

This requires having the [`bun`](https://bun.sh/) tool installed:

Check if bun is installed with:

```sh
bun --version
```

If not installed, run the following command:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

Install the dependencies:

```sh
cd portal
bun install
```

To run a server-side portal:

```sh
bun run server
```

To run a service-worker portal:

```sh
bun build:worker
bun run worker
```

To serve one of the portals. Typically, you will find it served at `localhost:3000` (for the server
side portal) or `localhost:8080` for the service worker (but check the output of the serve
command).

## Next Steps

As a next step, you can bring your own domain to the portal. This is useful if you want to use
Walrus Sites to host your site under a custom domain name. Learn how to do this in
the [next section][own-domain].
